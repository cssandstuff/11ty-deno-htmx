Now that Eleventy supports ESM (from version 3.x), it means we can use it in places we couldn't previously.

## Deno

Deno is a fast, secure and great alternative to Node and now supports most of the node ecosystem, so it seems like a great time to try and bring the two together in a starter project, and that's exactly what this is. Deno.deploy is also a super great place to try out ideas and has native key-pair database for doing server-side like things.

## Htmx

Not really neccessary, but I like what this project sets out to acheive and it pairs great with Eleventy... you can do client side routing pretty easily with minimal changes to your markup.
